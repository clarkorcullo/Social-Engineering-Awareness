# Social Engineering Awareness for BSIT Students - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This is a Capstone 1 project for BSIT students at Map√∫a Malayan Digital College (MMDC) focused on developing a **Social Engineering Awareness and Defense Mechanisms** program for IT students across all specializations.

## Project Team
- **David Algerico M. Diaz**
- **Jan Thadeus R. Mercado** 
- **Claros C. Orcullo**
- **Jasmin A. Pascual**
- **Section S3102, BSIT Major in Network and Cybersecurity**

## Project Objectives

### Primary Goal
Assess the level of social engineering awareness among IT students at MMDC and design an academic intervention to improve their ability to recognize and respond to social engineering threats.

### Specific Objectives
1. Assess current cognitive awareness (knowledge) of IT students related to social engineering tactics
2. Assess current attitudes of IT students towards social engineering threats and cybersecurity practices
3. Assess current behavioral practices of IT students concerning social engineering defense mechanisms
4. Identify specific cognitive misunderstandings of social engineering tactics among MMDC IT students
5. Identify specific behavioral susceptibilities to social engineering attacks
6. Analyze relevant awareness frameworks and educational models
7. Design an educational intervention tailored to MMDC's IT students
8. Propose implementation and evaluation strategies

## Research Questions
1. What is the current level of social engineering awareness among IT students at MMDC?
2. Which types of social engineering attacks are students most susceptible to?
3. What are the behavioral and cognitive patterns that prevent students from recognizing and responding to social engineering attempts?
4. How do existing institutional cybersecurity culture and policies influence MMDC IT students' cybersecurity behavior and awareness?
5. What learning materials, simulations, and delivery methods can be effectively designed?
6. How can the effectiveness of a social engineering awareness intervention be measured?

## Target Audience
- MMDC IT students across all specializations:
  - Network and Cybersecurity
  - Software Development
  - Data Analytics
  - Marketing Technology
  - Entrepreneurship Technology

## Proposed Solution: Academic Intervention

### Platform Architecture
- **Primary Platform**: MMDC's existing LMS (MyCamu)
- **Alternative Platforms**: Canvas, Google Classroom, Google Workspace
- **Access**: Laptops, tablets, smartphones

### Core Components
1. **Online Learning Platform** - Central hub for student access and content management
2. **Interactive Modules** - Primary learning content
3. **Simulation Environment** - Practical exercises
4. **Facilitated Workshops** - Optional component for deeper engagement

### Learning Workflow
1. **Baseline Assessment** - Initial survey to assess current awareness
2. **Progressive Learning Modules** - Structured content delivery
3. **Interactive Simulations** - Hands-on practice scenarios
4. **Assessment & Evaluation** - Knowledge and behavioral testing
5. **Follow-up Evaluation** - Long-term impact measurement

### Content Structure (Proposed Weekly Learning Modules)
- **Module 1**: Introduction to Social Engineering and Human Vulnerabilities
- **Module 2**: Types of Social Engineering Attacks (Phishing, Pretexting, etc.)
- **Module 3**: Psychological Principles and Manipulation Techniques
- **Module 4**: Real-world Scenarios and Case Studies
- **Module 5**: Defense Mechanisms and Best Practices
- **Module 6**: Reporting and Incident Response
- **Module 7**: Advanced Topics and Emerging Threats
- **Module 8**: Final Assessment and Practical Application

## Implementation Phases

### Phase A: Capstone 2 Kick-off & Setup
- Platform setup and configuration
- Content development
- Pilot testing preparation

### Phase B: Prototyping & Initial Evaluation
- Pilot testing with 30-50 students
- Feedback collection and analysis
- Program refinement

### Phase C: Core Rollout & Final Defense Preparation
- Full implementation
- Data collection and analysis
- Final defense preparation

### Phase D: Post-Defense Finalization
- Documentation completion
- Sustainability planning
- Train-the-trainer model implementation

## Evaluation Metrics

### Success Criteria
- **KM1**: Knowledge Improvement - Statistically significant increase in knowledge scores
- **AM1**: Attitude Change - Positive shift in attitudes towards security practices
- **BM1**: Behavioral Change (Defense) - Reduction in susceptibility to simulated attacks
- **BM2**: Behavioral Change (Reporting) - Increase in proactive reporting behavior
- **UM1**: Program Usability - Greater than 85% positive usability rating
- **CR1**: Program Completion Rate - Greater than 90% completion rate

### Evaluation Frameworks
- **KAP Model**: Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices
- **Kirkpatrick's Four Levels**: Reactions, Learning, Behavior/Transfer, Results
- **Protection Motivation Theory (PMT)**: Threat appraisal and coping appraisal

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- User authentication and progress tracking
- Interactive learning modules with multimedia content
- Simulation environment for practical exercises
- Assessment and quiz functionality
- Feedback and reporting mechanisms
- Mobile-responsive design

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability to accommodate large student cohorts
- Accessibility across different devices
- Data security and privacy compliance
- Integration with existing MMS systems
- Performance and reliability standards

## Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent for all participants
- Data anonymization and privacy protection
- Voluntary participation with withdrawal rights
- Minimal risk assessment and mitigation
- Secure data storage and handling

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Baseline Assessment Survey** - Initial awareness evaluation
2. **Learning Management System** - Complete online platform
3. **Interactive Learning Modules** - 8-week structured content
4. **Simulation Scenarios** - Practical exercise environment
5. **Evaluation Tools** - Pre/post testing and feedback mechanisms
6. **Documentation** - Implementation guide and sustainability plan
7. **Research Paper** - Complete capstone documentation

## Timeline
- **Capstone 1**: Research, design, and proposal (Current Phase)
- **Capstone 2**: Development, implementation, and evaluation (Next Phase)

## Significance
This project addresses a critical gap in cybersecurity education by focusing on human vulnerabilities rather than technical defenses, preparing future IT professionals to recognize and resist manipulation-based attacks in an increasingly digital world.
